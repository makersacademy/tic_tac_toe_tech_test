## User Stories

As an 'almost finished Makers course' student,  

So I can relax,  
I want to play a game of tic-tac-toe with a friend  

So I can decide where to put my first move,  
I want to see the empty board  

So I can make my move,  
I want to input my command through the command line  

So I can decide my next move,  
I want to see the board after every move  

So I know who won,  
I want to see the result of the game when it's over  




## Requirements

* Your goal is to write a program that lets two humans play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other.
* Implement a command line interface that lets the humans play the game by typing commands into the terminal.
* Players should be able to input their moves.
* The board should be shown after each move.
* The game should announce the result of the game when it's over.

### Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe

```
O X X
X X O
O X O
```

* There are two players in the game (X and O).
* The board is 9 positions in a 3x3 grid.
* Players take turns until the game is over.
* A player can claim a position if it is not already taken.
* A turn ends when a player claims a position.
* A player wins if they make a line by claiming 3 boxes in a row, 3 positions in a column, or 3 positions in a diagonal.
* If all positions are taken and neither player has a line, the game is a draw.
