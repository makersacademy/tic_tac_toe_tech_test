**User stories**
```
As a player
So that I can see the unclaimed positions
I want to print out the grid of cells

As a player
So that I can win the game
I want to be able to input my move

As a player
So that I know if I won
I want to see the result when the game is over

* There are two players in the game (X and O).
* The board is 9 positions in a 3x3 grid.
* Players take turns until the game is over.
* A player can claim a position if it is not already taken.
* A turn ends when a player claims a position.
* A player wins if they make a line by claiming 3 boxes in a row, 3 positions in a column, or 3 positions in a diagonal.
* If all positions are taken and neither player has a line, the game is a draw.
